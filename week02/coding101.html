  <h1>JDM Vs Muscles cars</h1>

<p>I really enjoy any class of car, sport, luxury, muscle, jdm, off-road. Each class has something to offer depending on you interest. There are also cars that offer more than one, maybe sport luxury car, or luxury SUV etc. But one thing in the car community loves to debate is American based muscle cars or JDM (japanses domestic market) cars.

<h2>Muscle Cars</h2>

<p>Muscle cars originated in America a <em>golden</em> era of the muscle cars was in the 1960s and 70s. These were all cars that focused on straight line speed and horsepower. With a big V8 and maybe a supercharger, when you put your foot down, you went as <strong>fast</strong> as a supercar for not necessarily the price of a supercar. </p>

<h3>Examples of Muscle cars</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ford Msutang</li>
  <li>Chervrolet Camero</li>
  <li>Dodge Charger</li>
  <li>Dodge Challenger</li>
</ul>

<h2>JDM cars</h2>

<p>JDM originated in Japan and people will most likely have heard of the JDM cars of the 1980s and 90s.JDM cars usually have a turbocharger and a smaller engine than a muscle car. However, unlike the speed hungry Americans, the Japanese made their cars fast while taking corners with ease. JDM cars are highly sought after and some are becoming <em>rare</em> and <strong>expensive</strong> nowadays.

<h3>Examples of JDM cars</h3>

  <li>Nissan skyline GTR</li>
  <li>Mazda RX7</li>
  <li>Toyota Supra</li>
  <li>Subaru WRX</li>
